		<h1>Movies reviews</h1>
		<div>
		    <p>"Lots of heat , but not very much light. It came across as a daytime soap opera version showing the personalities of</p>
		    <p>the players rather than dealing with the nuts and bolts of what reall happened. Even that would  have not been so bad but</p>
			<p>the movies tries to portray lots of these folks as sympathetic figures just trying to do the right thing."</p>
		    <br>
			<p>" I watching this for 3rd time, trying to understand how this large capitalist pigs could royally screw their</p>
		    <p>families, descendants, neighbors, countrymen and the rest of the whole world with absolutely no compassion.</p>
